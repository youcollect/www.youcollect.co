<h1>
Are you in for buying and collecting some of the most desirable smart contracts collectibles?
</h1>

<h2>Here is an overview of how YouCollect works:</h2>
<p>
    Every unique location has one smart contract token. 
    If you buy it, you own it – nobody else can have the token unless they pay you double the price you originally paid for the contract.
</p>
<p>
    YouCollect smart contracts are permanently visible on the Ethereum blockchain, and can only be purchased with Ether.
    Every contract acts as a "coin" or "token" and can only be owned by one person, just like cryptocurrencies! 
</p>
<p>
    You can purchase any YouCollect contract that you’re willing to pay the price for.
    In the same vein, anyone can purchase your contracts as long as they’re willing to send you 2X what you originally paid for the contract.
</p>
<p>
    We have a hard coded value appreciation is 2X from a contract price of 
    0 ETH to 1.2 ETH, 1.5X from 1.2 ETH to 5 ETH and 1.2X from 5 ETH and up.
</p>
<p>
    YouCollect collectibles are organized in a hierarchy. When cards lower in the hierarchy are traded. Cards higher up will each earn 1% of the trade.
    There are many other game mechanics, you can explore by looking at all kinds of game cards.
    Check out the deployed smart contract to verify the functionality.
