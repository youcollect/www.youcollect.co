<h1>Getting started</h1>

<p>
    <b>Are there any requriements to play YouCollect?</b>
</p>
<p>There are! You must be over 21 years old, and you must be a citizen of a country, where using our specific Etherium-Smart-Contracts is legal.</p>

<p><b>What software do I need to play YouCollect?</b></p>

<p>
    Playing by buying and trading YouCollect tokens only requires three things:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A computer with a Chrome or Firefox browser installed.
    </li>
    <li>
        A MetaMask digital wallet
    </li>
    <li>
        Ether, the cryptocurrency used to buy YouCollect contracts
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    <b>How do I install MetaMask?</b>
</p>
<p>
    In order to buy contracts and sell your contracts, you’ll need to install digital wallet MetaMask on your Chrome or Firefox browser and load it up with ether.
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        
            Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn and click “Add to Chrome”. Or, go to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ether-metamask/ and click “Add to Firefox”.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click “Add Extension” on the pop-up.
        </li>
        <li>
            Accept the Privacy Policy and agree to the TOS.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set up your MetaMask account.
        </li>
        <li>
            Copy your 12 seed words and file them away somewhere safe (this helps to secure your account).Note: For security purposes, MetaMask browser extensions will periodically request that you log back in to your account. If you see a lock screen on YouCollect, this security measure is the most likely cause – just click your MetaMask extension, log back in, and continue buying and trading smart contracts.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <b>How do I add ether to my MetaMask wallet?</b>
</p>
<p>
    There are two ways to add ether to your wallet. If you don’t currently own ether, you can:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Buy ether directly in MetaMask. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Purchase ether through a Coinbase wallet, another type of digital wallet, and then transfer the ether to your MetaMask wallet using the Coinbase widget.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    If you currently own ether, you can: Transfer your ether from your existing digital wallet to your MetaMask wallet. Just copy your MetaMask address, open up Coinbase, and click on the “Accounts” option. Click the “Send” button, paste your MetaMask address in the box, add the amount of ether you want to transfer, and complete the transaction.

<h2>All about YouCollect</h2>
<p>
    <b>
        What exactly is YouCollect?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
YouCollect is collectibe smart contract token game. You can collect all kind of fun collectibles! When you own a token, you get "taxes" from the tiers beneath you.
</p>
<p>
    <b>
How do I buy a collectible smart contract?
    </b>
</p><p>
Head on over to the YouCollect Marketplace, scroll through the collectible contracts, and click on “Buy this Contract” if you see a token you’re interested in. You’ll need to have enough ether in your MetaMask wallet to cover the transaction; once you follow through the prompts and transfer the funds, you’re officially the only person in the world who owns that collectible contract.
<p>
    <b>
How much do collectible smart contracts cost?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
That depends on the collectible. Because each contract increases in cost after every transaction, the cost of each contract depends on how many times the contract has changed hands in ownership.
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        Can I decide not to sell my collectible contract if someone wants to purchase it?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
Nope – that’s the game!. Anyone can purchase any contract that you own, any time that they want to. However, you get up to double your purchase price in return. 
</p><p>
    <b>
        Can I use my normal currency (USD, EUR, RMB, etc.) to buy collectible contracts?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
No. Because YouCollect is run on the same blockchain technology used by Ethereum, ether is the only currency you can use to purchase YouCollect contracts. You can convert your standard currency into ether through an exchange or directly through your MetaMask wallet (depending on where you live).
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        Are YouCollect a type of cryptocurrency?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
Think of YouCollect smart contracts as collectibles – the new version of sports cards, collectible figurines, or even modern artwork. While they do have value, that value is based on their desirability. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        Why isn’t my sale showing up on Etherscan?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
No worries – it is. You just need to click over to the “internal transactions” tab to see the sale and wait until the transaction is recorded. Registering transaction on the blockchain requires lots of computer all over the world to sync the data. This take some time, just like a bitcoin or ethereum transfer, but also ensures and secures your ownership of the World token.
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        Why can’t I play YouCollect on my phone or tablet?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the current technology used to run the game is too much for your phone to handle. If your tablet runs Firefox or Chrome, you can play YouCollect on your tablet; however, the system runs best on a desktop or laptop with Metamask installed.
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        This has to be a scam. How are you making money?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
We take a small percentage of each transaction when a collectible is purchased. That’s it. The whole source code is open to you to verfiy, and up to you to decide if you are willing to play this game. If you see a contract on the marketplace that you want to buy, you can do so for the full price, and then you own it. It’s super easy.
